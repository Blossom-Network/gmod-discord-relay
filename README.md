# gmod-discord-relay

Don't use on production servers, in early development.
Just a little proof on concept using GWSockets + discord.js.

# Installation

1. Install discord.js using NPM (npm install node.js)
2. Configure bot using config.example.json and rename it to config.json
3. Start bot.
4. Install GWSockets module for your operating system (i'm using Windows, so I'm including Windows binary).
5. Configure LUA script to connect to your websocket from index.jsw.
6. Start server.
